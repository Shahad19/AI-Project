# Housing Sale Project MVP

The main objective is to create a model that predicts the real-estate prices using one of the most commonly machine learning method which is Linear Regression.real-estate data were scraped and collected from AQAR and Propertyfinder websites which are a property search websites. The data were properly cleaned, and EDA were performed to further analyze and explore patterns and correlations between the variables/features. Here is some of the results we have explored :

The above figures show the correlations between the five features, the main insights are: 
- The "Size" feature has high positive correlation 0.65 with our target "Price"
- The "Bathrooms" feature has positive correlation 0.31 with our target "Price"
- The "Bedrooms" feature has low positive correlation 0.16 with our target "Price"

The correlation in the figure above between features, we can ensure that Size has properly linear correlation with our target "Price".

The next step will be working on the models (linear regression model, Lasso model, stats models, sklearn, poly nomial).
we need to do analysis in order to increase the R and increase the cross validation score, also, we need to do more plots to see the fit of the model.
