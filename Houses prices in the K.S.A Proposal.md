# Houses prices in the K.S.A

# Backstory

Residential real estate market In the regions of the Kingdom Saudi Arabia, real estate prices may change dynamically as it is difficult for property owners to measure pricing standards well. In order to facilitate the pricing process for landlords, we decided to develop a solution that aims to predict real estate prices based on a machine learning algorithm. Specifically, we will use a linear regression model. To do this, we will use the aqar website using comprehensive analysis tools. aqar is a website aimed at people who want to sell their homes and people who are looking for real estate.

# Data Description

We compiled the dataset from their website "https://sa.aqar.fm/", which targets people wanting to sell their homes and another source (Structured Dataset) containing 6 columns and 1001 rows with extension csv. The data contains the following columns:

- Price              Price that the house sold at.
- Num_Of_Bedrooms    Number of Bedrooms for Houses.
- Num_Of_Bathrooms   Number of Bathrooms for Houses.
- Size(m²)           Area of the Houses.
- District           Neighborhood names for Houses.
- StreetWidth        Street Width of the Houses.

# Tools

- To explore and analyze the data we well use Jupiter Notebook, Python language. 
- Python Libraries: Numpy, matplotlib,seaborn,correlation,pandas and BeautifulSoup.
- In addition, creating and evaluating Linear Regression Model.
